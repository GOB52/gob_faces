# M5STrek

[日本語](README.md)

This is an example of using the M5Stack Faces Keyboard.  
This is a port of an old text game, Star Trek Game (TinyBASIC version) as a motif.

## Input
Since it is tedious to input numerical values after pressing the sym key each time, numerical values can be input even if sym is not pressed.
