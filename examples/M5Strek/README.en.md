# M5STrek

[日本語](README.md)

This is an example of using the M5Stack Faces Keyboard.  
This is a port of an old text game, Star Trek Game (TinyBASIC version) as a motif.  
Since this is not a complete port, some rules and indications are different.

## Input
Since it is tedious to input numerical values after pressing the sym key each time, numerical values can be input even if sym is not pressed.  
The Enter key must be entered to terminate the command or any other input.

#### Note
Due to rights issues, the spaceship is named "M5Stack" and the characters are those associated with M5Unified.
